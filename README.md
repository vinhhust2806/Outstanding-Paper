# Outstanding Papers

## LLM and RAG
[Enhancing Q&A Text Retrieval with Ranking Models: Benchmarking, fine-tuning and deploying Rerankers for RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07691) (NVIDIA-AI, 2024)

- The paper introduces a state-of-the-art ranking model, NV-RerankQAMistral-4B-v3, which achieves a significant accuracy increase of 14% compared to pipelines with other rerankers.

## Medical Imaging
[DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13094) (Bilkent University, 2024) \
[Code](https://github.com/icon-lab/DenoMamba)

- The paper proposes DenoMamba, a novel deep learning model for low-dose CT denoising.
- Among the earliest state-space models (SSM) for image denoising, DenoMamba fuses spatial and channel SSM modules within a unified hourglass architecture to achieve high-quality reconstruction of CT images from low-dose measurements.
